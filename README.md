### Create a Quiz
The quiz should be based on computer science and the environment. Use comments to indicate the right answer (for me when I'm marking). There should be at least 10 questions. The questions should have multiple choice (at least one question must have at least two right answers) and fill in the blank. Keep score of the quiz and give a letter grade at the end using the grade range below:  
  
The following ranges can be found here:  
90 to 100     A+  
85 to 89      A  
80 to 84      A-  
77 to 79      B+  
73 to 76      B  
70 to 72      B-  
67 to 69      C+  
63 to 67      C  
60 to 62      C-  
57 to 50      D+  
53 to 56      D  
50 to 52      D-  
  
You may edit this readme if needed to keep notes.
